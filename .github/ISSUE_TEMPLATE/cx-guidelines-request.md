<!--- Do not delete disclaimer: START DISCLAIMER --->
:warning: **Disclaimer** :warning:
The CX Guidelines provide optional examples of key requirements and recommendations to help organisations build best practice consent models. They are published online [here](https://d61cds.notion.site/). [CX Guidelines](https://d61cds.notion.site/) are optional to follow, while [CX Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#consumer-experience) are binding data standards that are mandatory to follow. While the CX Guidelines are not mandatory, the CDR Rules require CDR Participants to have regard to them.

The CX Guidelines demonstrate key aspects of the consent model and cover specific rules, standards, and best practice recommendations. The scope of the CX Guidelines is not exhaustive, and certain areas may be considered out of scope. This may include, for example, where the rules and/or standards are silent or non-prescriptive to provide CDR participants with flexibility or discretion according to their own systems or protocols.

Requests for CX Guidelines will be considered by the DSB on a case by case basis, based on whether providing CX Guidelines for the item is in scope for the DSB; consistent with policy objectives; and is supported by the community.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:**N.B.** Because the CX Guidelines span policy, rules, standards, and best practice considerations, their development and release may not fall within a Maintenance Iteration cycle.
