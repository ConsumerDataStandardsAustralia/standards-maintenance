# Overview

* **Specification:** Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels
* **Baseline Version:** [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
* **Target Version:** [RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)

# Summary of key changes

* RFC8174 clarifies that only keywords in UPPERCASE have the meaning of a requirement level keyword. Where the lowercase is used in documentation, it does not take on the meaning of a requirement level keyword.
* It introduced the new keyword "NOT RECOMMENDED"

# Analysis
Section | Change | Summary
2. Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words | Definition of a keyword | Use of keywords is only implied when the keyword is provided in UPPERCASE
2. Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words | "NOT RECOMMENDED" | "NOT RECOMMENDED" is explicitly defined as a synonym for "SHOULD NOT"

# Impact analysis to the Consumer Data Standards
* Any intended use of a requirement level keyword needs to be UPPERCASE
* Does not give rise to any breaking changes because the correct interpretation of RFC2119 is that lowercase usage of keywords is permitted

# Recommendations
* Adopt RFC8174 _in addition to_ RFC2119. Because RFC8174 is a clarification on best practice when applying RFC2119 both RFCs apply.
* RFC8174 should be introduced as an informative reference.
* All references to requirement level keywords that **are not** UPPERCASE must be reviewed in the Consumer Data Standards. Where a requirement level is implied, the word must be changed to UPPERCASE. Where the use of the word is not intended to imply a requirement level, a different word should be used to reduce possible ambiguity for implementers
