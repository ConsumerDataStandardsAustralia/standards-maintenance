# Overview

* **Specification:** Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels
* **Baseline Version:** [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
* **Target Version:** [RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)

This document summarises the changes between the RFC2119 on Requirements Level and the amendments made in RFC8174 and identifies the impacts to the Consumer Data Standards.

Impact analysis is compared against v1.10.0 of the Consumer Data Standards.

# Summary of key changes

* RFC8174 clarifies that only keywords in UPPERCASE have the meaning of a requirement level keyword. Where the lowercase is used in documentation, it does not take on the meaning of a requirement level keyword.
* It introduced the new keyword "NOT RECOMMENDED"

# Analysis

| Section | Change | Summary  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2. Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words | Definition of a keyword | Use of keywords is only implied when the keyword is provided in UPPERCASE |
| 2. Clarifying Capitalization of Key Words | "NOT RECOMMENDED" | "NOT RECOMMENDED" is explicitly defined as a synonym for "SHOULD NOT" |

# Impact analysis to the Consumer Data Standards

* Any intended use of a requirement level keyword needs to be UPPERCASE
* Does not give rise to any breaking changes because the correct interpretation of RFC2119 is that lowercase usage of keywords is permitted

# Recommendations

* Adopt RFC8174 _in addition to_ RFC2119. Because RFC8174 is a clarification on best practice when applying RFC2119 both RFCs apply.
* RFC8174 should be introduced as an informative reference.
* All references to requirement level keywords that **are not** UPPERCASE must be reviewed in the Consumer Data Standards. Where a requirement level is implied, the word must be changed to UPPERCASE. Where the use of the word is not intended to imply a requirement level, a different word should be used to reduce possible ambiguity for implementers
