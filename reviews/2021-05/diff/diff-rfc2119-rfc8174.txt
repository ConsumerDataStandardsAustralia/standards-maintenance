<         Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels

< Status of this Memo

<    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
<    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
<    improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

< Abstract
23,27d46
<    In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
<    the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
<    capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
<    interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
<    should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
29,32d47
<       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
<       NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
<       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<       RFC 2119.
34,35d48
<    Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
<    level of the document in which they are used.
37,38d49
< 1. MUST   This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the
<    definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
40,41d50
< 2. MUST NOT   This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the
<    definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
43,46d51
< 3. SHOULD   This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
<    may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
<    particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
<    carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
48,52d52
< 4. SHOULD NOT   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
<    there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
<    particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
<    implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
<    before implementing any behavior described with this label.

< 5. MAY   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
<    truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
<    particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
<    it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
<    An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be
<    prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
<    include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
<    same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
<    MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
<    does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
<    option provides.)

<    Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care

<    potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For
<    example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
<    on implementors where the method is not required for
<    interoperability.

<    These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security
<    implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a MUST or
<    SHOULD, or doing something the specification says MUST NOT or SHOULD
<    NOT be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time
<    to elaborate the security implications of not following
<    recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have
<    had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the
<    specification.

>    In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all capitals
>    as shown below, are used to signify the requirements in the
>    specification.  These capitalized words can bring significant clarity
>    and consistency to documents because their meanings are well defined.
>    This document defines how those words are interpreted in IETF
>    documents when the words are in all capitals.
> 
>    o  These words can be used as defined here, but using them is not
>       required.  Specifically, normative text does not require the use
>       of these key words.  They are used for clarity and consistency
>       when that is what's wanted, but a lot of normative text does not
>       use them and is still normative.
> 
>    o  The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in
>       all capitals.
